            <p>Hi, I'm Diego.</p>

                <p>I’m an MD/PhD candidate at the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu" target="_blank">Yale School of Medicine</a>, fully funded by the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/mdphd/" target="_blank">Medical Scientist Training Program</a>.</p>
                <p>I think a lot about virtual tissues, control of cell systems, AI, complexity theory, regenerative biology, BCIs, and a world where death isn’t mandatory.</p>
                <p>This year, alongside my medical studies and rotations in PhD labs, I’m part of the <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/" target="_blank">2025 Nucleate Activator Program</a>, working on next generation chips for human computer interfaces.</p>
                <p>If there weren’t still a million ways to improve human health using science and technology, you might find me <a href="https://slacktivity.com/highlining-what-is-it/?srsltid=AfmBOopI8aRlb_r0F95SB-Nxf_WQtlutisiRoSTiMppjk_6ZrkxhyEHF" target="_blank">highlining</a>, painting, writing, or talking about the philosophy I coined called Optimistic Absurdism.</p>
                <p>Please accept this website and my writings as an untethered handshake into the electronic world and consider reaching out if you find we’re on the same wavelength.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>Tracing back some of the formative experiences that got me here and turned me into who I am today:</p>
                <p>Before Yale, I worked for 2 years at the <a href="https://hscrb.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Stem Cell Institute</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_lineage" target="_blank">lineage tracing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_single_cell_omics_methods" target="_blank">single cell technologies</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics#:~:text=Multiomics%2C%20multi%2Domics%2C%20integrative,it%20is%20sequenced)%3B%20in" target="_blank">multi-omic profiling tools</a> in the hematology oncology lab of <a href="https://camargolab.squarespace.com" target="_blank">Dr. Fernando Camargo</a>.</p>
                <p>For undergrad, I was fortunate to get admitted into the Columbia Honors program and Brown University, though I decided to accept a full ride offer to study <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/integrative-neuroscience/" target="_blank">Integrative Neuroscience</a> as a National Hispanic scholar at Fordham University. My studies involved computational, cellular, molecular, and behavioral neuroscience, with minors in Biochemistry & Philosophy. I also competed as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I" target="_blank">Division I</a> athlete on Fordham's Swim and Dive team (Springboard Diving, 1m, 3m).</p>
                <p>In NYC, I investigated epigenetic sex differences that occur in the brain reward area as a result of early-life stress in <a href="https://kundakoviclab.com/research/" target="_blank">Dr. Marija Kundakovic’s</a> lab and published on tissue engineering/drug design using molecular dynamics simulations with <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/chemistry/faculty/ipsita-banerjee/" target="_blank">Dr. Ipsita Banerjee</a>.</p>
                <p>During COVID, I also interned at the <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/brain-injury" target="_blank">Brain Injury Research Center at Mt. Sinai</a> and volunteered at the <a href="https://stayinstep.org" target="_blank">“Stay in Step" Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Center</a> in my hometown of Tampa, Florida.</p>
                <p>Between science and athletics, I took private seminars in the Philosophy of Perception, wrote essays on existential AI risk and neuroethics, and took a graduate course in the Philosophy of Science. For the well initiated, I might be best described as adjacent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotivism" target="_blank">ethical emotivism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism" target="_blank">Pyrrhonian skepticism</a>, yet still a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livewired_(book)#:~:text=Livewired%3A%20The%20Inside%20Story%20of,a%20term%20to%20supersede%20plastic." target="_blank">livewired</a> and hopefully agentic optimist. I think the best way towards a wonderful future is by facing our hardest challenges head on. </p>
